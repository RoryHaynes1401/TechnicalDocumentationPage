      Swift is a powerful and intuitive
      programming language for macOS, iOS,watchOS and tvOS. Writing Swift code
      is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift
      includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design,
      yet also produces software that runs lightning-fast.</p>

      <p><code>let Playgrounds : bool = true</code><br><br>
        In Swift Playgrounds you create small programs called “playgrounds”
        that instantly show the results of the code that you write. A single
        line of code can make amazing things happen. </p>
      <p>
        Interactive lessons teach
        key coding concepts, and additional challenges and templates encourage
        you to explore code in exciting new ways and to create something
        completely unique. There are even playgrounds that use Bluetooth to
        control robots, drones, and other hardware accessories. It’s easy to
        share your creations with friends, or record and post videos of your
        playgrounds in action.</p>

        Swift 4 was developed in the open at Swift.org, with source code,
        a bug tracker, mailing lists, and regular development builds available
        for everyone. This broad community of developers, both inside Apple as
        well as hundreds of outside contributors, work together to make Swift
        even more amazing. </p>
        <p>Swift already supports all Apple platforms as well
        as Linux, with community members actively working to port to even more
        platforms. We’re excited to see more ways in which Swift makes software
        safer and faster, while also making programming more fun.</p>

      <header><h1>Source Compatibility Modes</h1></header>
      <p><code>@interface CompatibleObject : NSObject </code><br><br>
        Swift 3 set up the language
        for source-level stability and now Swift 4
        delivers source compatibility as a feature moving forward. With Swift 4,
        you don’t have to modify any of your code to use the new version of the
        compiler. </p>
      <p>Instead you can start using the new Swift 4 compiler and
        migrate at your own pace, taking advantage of new Swift 4 features,
        one module at a time.

        You can use the new Swift 4 compiler with three different modes:
          <ul>
            <li>Swift 3 mode is the default for existing code and will build source
            code that built with the Swift 3 compiler.</li>
            <li>Swift 4 mode enables you to use new features and performance
            optimizations of Swift 4, some of which may require migration,
            making it easier to migrate than the previous transition from
            Swift 2.2 to Swift 3.</li>
            <li>Mixed mode allows you to take advantage of interoperability between
            binaries built with the same compiler. This helps developers who have
            projects that mix packages written with Swift 3 with packages written
            with Swift 4, as long as all packages are built using the Swift 4
            compiler. This allows developers to gradually migrate specific
            portions of their code to Swift 4 over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <li>Faster, easier to use Strings that retain Unicode correctness and add support for creating, using and managing substrings.</li>
            <li>Smart key paths for type-safe, efficient, extensible key value coding for Swift types.</li>
            <li>Enhancements to creating and manipulating Dictionary and Set types.</li>
            <li>Extends support of archival and serialization to struct and enum types
                and enables type-safety for serializing to external formats such as JSON
                and plist.
            </li>
            <li>Enforced exclusive access to memory.</li>
